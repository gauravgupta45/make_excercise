## A usual c program used to implement GNUs 'make' tool.

* Program takes a number as an input, and returns # of high and low bits from its binary representation.
* `main.c` program uses a header file `functions.h` (in `src/` dir) declaring the functions used by the driver program. 
* `make` is used to eliminate the mundane aspects of compiling and executing the program.
